# Project Domains
#
# Shared definition of all project domains for setup skills.
# Skills can load this file to get the canonical list of domains.
#
# Usage in skills:
#   Reference: plugins/crunch/data/domains.yaml
#   Load domains list and filter by required/optional as needed.
#
# vendor_requirements: List of capabilities a vendor must support for this domain.
# Used by lookup-vendor to evaluate vendor fit and by setup skills to verify configuration.
