# Project Info

We need to understand the project's purpose, goals, and context. This helps Claude make better decisions aligned with your objectives.

## What to Clarify

- **Project name** - What is the project called?
- **Goal** - What is the main purpose of the project? (one sentence)
- **Problem** - What problem does this project solve for users?
- **Target users** - Who will use this project?
- **Objectives** - What are 3-5 specific outcomes or deliverables?

## Optional

- **Success criteria** - How will you know the project is successful?
- **Constraints** - Any limitations, requirements, or boundaries?
- **Out of scope** - What is explicitly NOT part of this project?
- **Stakeholders** - Key people involved and their interests?

## Examples

**Good goal statement:**

**Good constraints:**
> - Must integrate with existing Shopify API
